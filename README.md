To everyone cloning this!! In android studio, open to the Calendar folder, not the root. Otherwise gradle won't build properly

Also, you can fork if you want, but then any changes made will become a pull request that needs to be approved. If you clone instead, changes can be made in real time. Choose whichever you prefer, but I don't see any pull requests on my end yet

Also also, if prompted, don't update gradle. Seems like a good idea, but don't
