To everyone cloning this!! In android studio, open to the Calendar folder, not the root. Otherwise gradle won't build properly

Also, clone the repository (or download the zip file) rather than forking it. Forking makes your own repo, which wont be merged into this project

Also also, if prompted, don't update gradle. Seems like a good idea, but don't
